# Events
* this document describes all of the events on the lavad consensus
* events are divided between events types such as: 'NewBlock' 'Tx' etc..
* a client can subscribe to event types. see more at: https://docs.tendermint.com/master/tendermint-core/subscription.html#subscribing-to-events-via-websocket, API docs link within the page has further information

# Logging
## events
* all added events should start with "lava_" for differentiation between cosmos and tendermint events and custom lava events
* events should have an indicative name, stating what is the action that is logged
* error events should be created too, starting with ERR_, for failed state transitions.
* a wrapper for all events exist in utils/lavalog.go
```
utils.LogLavaEvent()
utils.LavaError()
