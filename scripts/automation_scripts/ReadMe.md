Automation Scripts Readme

# gRPC Spec Builder:

Used for verifying the REST part of a spec, and building the grpc part from it.
It uses the grpc descriptors of the endpoint you provide in order to cross validate the missing parts, and the grpc spec itself.

### Usage:

- Set the following parameters before use, for example:

```
grpc_server = "juno-node-1.lavapro.xyz:9090"
spec_current_file_path = "/home/user/go/src/lava/specs/mainnet-1/specs/juno.json"
```

Launch the script

```
python3 scripts/automation_scripts/grpc_spec_builder.py
```

Read the results carefully to understand if any Rest API's were missing / more than necessary. take a look at the new grpc spec file that was created

You can also uncomment the block of code at the bottom of the script that sets the grpc_server and spec_current_file_path variables to different values. This will allow you to switch between different gRPC servers and JSON files by simply commenting out the block of code that you are not using.

Note that you will need to have the grpcurl command-line tool installed and available in your system's PATH in order to run the script. grpcurl is a command-line tool for interacting with gRPC servers. You can download it from the gRPC GitHub page: https://github.com/grpc/grpc

# gRPC Scaffolder:

Used for Scaffolding grpc interface.

### Usage:

- Set the following parameters before use, for example:

```
grpc_server = "juno-node-1.lavapro.xyz:9090"
spec_current_file_path = "/home/user/go/src/lava/specs/mainnet-1/specs/juno.json"
chain = "Juno"
result_dir = "/home/user/go/src/lava/scripts/automation_scripts/automation_results/grpcClientProtobufs"
```

Launch the script, if grpc files are already located in there it will just append the missing API's.

- There might be bugs in the script as it wasnt tested enough, so make sure you have a backed up version from git. its alot easier to compare the diff afterwards

```
python3 scripts/automation_scripts/grpc_scaffolder.py
```
