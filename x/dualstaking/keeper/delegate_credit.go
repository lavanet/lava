// The credit mechanism is designed to fairly distribute rewards to delegators
// based on both the amount of tokens they delegate and the duration of their
// delegation. It ensures that rewards are proportional to the effective stake
// over time, rather than just the nominal amount of tokens delegated.
//
// Key Components:
// - Credit: Represents the effective delegation for a delegator, adjusted for
//   the time their tokens have been staked.
// - CreditTimestamp: Records the last time the credit was updated, allowing
//   for accurate calculation of rewards over time.
//
// How It Works:
// 1. When a delegation is made or modified, the credit is calculated based on
//    the current amount and the time elapsed since the last update.
// 2. The credit is normalized over a 30-day period to ensure consistent reward
//    distribution.
//
// Example 1:
// Consider two delegators, Alice and Bob, with a total delegators reward pool of 500 tokens.
// - Alice delegates 100 tokens for the full month, earning a credit of 100 tokens.
// - Bob delegates 200 tokens but only for half the month, earning a credit of 100 tokens.
//
// Total credit-adjusted delegations: Alice (100) + Bob (100) = 200 tokens.
// - Alice's reward: (500 * 100 / 200) = 250 tokens
// - Bob's reward: (500 * 100 / 200) = 250 tokens
//
// Example 2 (Mid-Month Delegation Change):
// Suppose Alice initially delegates 100 tokens, and halfway through the month,
// she increases her delegation to 150 tokens.
// - For the first half of the month, Alice's credit is calculated on 100 tokens.
// - When she increases her delegation, the credit is updated to reflect the rewards
//   earned so far (e.g., 50 tokens for 15 days).
// - The CreditTimestamp is updated to the current time.
// - For the remaining half of the month, her credit is calculated on 150 tokens.
