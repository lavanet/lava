// Delegation allows securing funds for a specific provider to effectively increase
// its stake so it will be paired with consumers more often. The delegators do not
// transfer the funds to the provider but only bestow the funds with it. In return
// to locking the funds there, delegators get some of the providerâ€™s profit (after
// commission deduction).
//
// The delegated funds are stored in the module's BondedPoolName account. On request
// to terminate the delegation, they are then moved to the modules NotBondedPoolName
// account, and remain locked there for staking.UnbondingTime() witholding period
// before finally released back to the delegator. The timers for bonded funds are
// tracked are indexed by the delegator, provider, and chainID.
//
// The delegation state is stores with fixation using two maps: one for delegations
// indexed by the combination <provider,chainD,delegator>, used to track delegations
// and find/access delegations by provider (and chainID); and another for delegators
// tracking the list of providers for a delegator, indexed by the delegator.
